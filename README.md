# Introduction 
Run and Shoot is a game that is developed for entertainment purposes. The user should reach the goal while avoiding the moving objects to win the game. The game starts by showing a menu to the user. User can choose between menu items which are formed of the user manual, single-player, multi-player, options, credit, and exit. In single-player mode, the user will see a map with one player. In multi-player mode, there are two players on the map who are also able to shoot each other. Players will be able to move using some control keys from the keyboard which is described in the user manual. In the options section, the user can choose between three different difficulty levels: easy, intermediate, hard. Finally, choosing the exit item, the game will be quit.
