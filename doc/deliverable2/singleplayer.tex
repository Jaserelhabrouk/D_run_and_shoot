This flow chart explains all the steps happening on single player mode. 
As it is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:singleplayer}, load the map block reads the map from a text file. Next, we do some setups for single player game based on the map. In these setups we define a map with position of the player, the goal, the barriers and the arrows.
We should then read the input keyboard buffer and wait for input. The reading process is done within a limited time and there exist a timeout which expires if no input is provided within that time. Then the program checks the input to see what key has entered. If pause button is entered, program goes to pause game state. If escape button is pressed, program goes to menu. If no keys has entered, program updates the position of barriers and arrows as they are moving objects. If entered keys are movement keys, program first check if the player's move is permitted or not (checks map walls and barriers); if yes, then program updates the player position, barriers and arrows locations, and checks if the player is hit. If player can not move, program only updates barriers and arrows and does not change player's location. If player is hit by an arrow, it loses one heart and immediately checks if there is any heart left for the player. If the player loses all of its hearts, player loses the game. If the player has still a heart, program check if the player reaches the goal. Player wins the game if it reach the goal, otherwise program \textcolor{blue}{\bf generate a view} to display any updates on the map. Then wait for input key and it will continue until the player wins or loses the game.
If there exist any graphic related procedures it is done in generate view process, and logic of the game does not need to worry about graphics.

\subsection{Single player functions prototypes}
In this section we define the required functions prototypes and its relation to flow chart~\ref{fig:singleplayer}. We define some functions and the rest of the code will be in a main function. Comments above each function mention the associated block, the release, and assignee.
